                        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
                        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
                        I got every penny’s worth.

                        “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve
                        been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                        had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                        course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
                        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched
                        careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                        “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code.
                        I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                        program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                        The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                        learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                        have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                        job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                        100% recommend! ”
